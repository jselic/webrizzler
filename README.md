## Webrizzler
While our IT solutions are applicable in a wider market, our application is simply designed for good fun. We are Fanum Faks, and our application is made for real-time translation of popular webpages, into various slangs, such as: 
- Generation Alpha Slang
- Communist
- Dog

Our app uses OpenAI's API, to transform text into a more "user-friendy" form, using the popular ChatGPT tool. 
To run our app, you need to export the repository as a google chrome plugin.
